"""One take directory -> one full clip record, and its ClipSummary projection.

WHY the summary is projected rather than built: the contract calls the clip record a
"strict SUPERSET of the ClipSummary ... identical name, type and meaning". Two
independent builders would drift on the first field anyone edited, so we build the full
record once and cut the summary out of it with `summary_from_clip` -- which makes the
superset property true by construction rather than by review.

WHY nothing here guesses: an undeterminable field is written as `null`, the UI renders
it as an em-dash, and the report names the take that produced it. The one place we fail
CLOSED instead of to null is `rights` -- there is no "unknown" permission, so an
unreviewed clip reads `denied` on all four.
