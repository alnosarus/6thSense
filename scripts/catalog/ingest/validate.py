"""Measured conformance: the H1/H3 sync record, the H2/H4 QA record, and bundle checks.

WHY sync, QA and validation share a module: they are the same activity -- deciding
whether what we measured is acceptable, and against which published bound. The grade
rule reads `sync.maximum_alignment_error_ms`, the H1 auto-flag threshold (33 ms, one
camera frame at 30 fps) appears in both the sync check and the grade, and the bundle
validator re-derives the same facts from the emitted files. Adjacency means each
threshold constant is written once and read three ways.

WHY the bundle validator re-derives instead of trusting: the manifest ships precomputed
facet counts and totals so the UI need not iterate 1000 clips to draw a header. That is
only safe if something proves the precomputation right, so `validate_bundle` recomputes
every aggregate from `clips[]`, resolves every relative URL, and fails on a mismatch.

#: THE FIFTH CHECK RESULT, AND THE ONLY ONE THAT DOES NOT CAP THE GRADE.
#:
#: `not_run` and `not_applicable` are both "no measurement", and collapsing them is what made
#: grade A unreachable for a camera-only package. They answer different questions:
#:
#:   not_run        -- the check APPLIES to this package and we did not run it. That is a gap
#:                     in our evidence and it caps the grade, forever, by design.
#:   not_applicable -- there is nothing for this check to measure, because the package does
#:                     not carry the thing it checks. A tactile CRC rate on a package with no
#:                     gloves is not an unmeasured number; it is not a number. Charging it
#:                     against the grade prices the product for a question about a different
#:                     product.
#:
#: This rig ships TWO products -- camera-only, and camera plus two gloves -- and they are
#: equals. Every use of this value below is gated on a structural fact that is published in
#: the same clip record (`hands == []`, `sync == null`), never on a measurement coming back
#: None. That gating is the whole safety property: a glove that WAS worn and produced no CRC
#: number still reads `not_run` and still caps the grade.

    B tests the H1 skew bound as well as the H2 ones. It used not to, which meant a clip

    tolerance". A clip that misses the H1 bound is grade C: accepted, with the exceedance
    named in known_limitations, which is what grade C is for.

    `inapplicable` is the set of `check_id`s this package reported as `not_applicable` --
    checks with nothing to measure because the product does not carry the stream they test.
    They are excluded from the set-membership gate AND they are what switches off the
    matching numeric gate. The two used to disagree: the numeric bounds were bypassed on
    `hands == []` while the set membership was not, so a flawless camera-only clip failed A
    on three tactile checks it could never have run and no amount of good capture could fix

    The numeric bypasses are keyed on the PUBLISHED check result rather than on `hands` or
