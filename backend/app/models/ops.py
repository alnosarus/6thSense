"""ORM models for the collector-operations area: wearers and episodes.

WHY THESE TABLES EXIST AT ALL
  The collector ledger began as a JSON file on one laptop
  (~/.egocam-ledger/ledger.json) whose own header says it "is the only copy of
  who was paid what". That is a payment record with no redundancy, no audit
  trail and no second reader. These tables are that file, in Postgres.

WHY A WEARER IS NOT A USER
  `users` is the login table. A wearer is a person who carried a camera; almost
  none of them will ever log in, and the ones who do must not become one row
  with two meanings. Deleting a login must not delete the payment history of
  the person it belonged to, which a shared table cannot promise.

WHY THE EPISODE CARRIES ITS OWN wearer_id
  The laptop ledger attributes an episode by looking up which collector held
  that device on that date. That is the right default and the wrong permanent
  record: a camera handed over at lunchtime splits a day no date range can
  express, and re-keying a range silently rewrites who was paid for episodes
  already settled. Resolve once, store the answer on the episode, and history
  stops moving.

#: How an episode was removed. 'soft' hides it from the working view and keeps
