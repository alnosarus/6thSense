"""The catalog API: auth, role redaction, presigning, path safety, Range.

Everything runs against the LOCAL driver pointed at
`tests/fixtures/catalog/bundle`: no AWS, and no dependency on a bundle outside
this repository. The local driver is not a stub — same CatalogStore, same
redaction pass, same resolve_key, differing only in how a relative path becomes
a URL — so what is nulled, what is never signed and what a hostile manifest
does all hold identically for S3. The store itself is unit-tested in
test_catalog_store.py.
